# deltaRateChanger
My attempt at creating a rate changer for osu.
Written in python using PyQt5.

# Install and setup
0. Install python (obviously).
1. Download ffmpeg, ffprobe binaries, place them in the folder with this program(or make them system-wide by adding them to a PATH variable added folder)
2. Install pyqt5: pip install pyqt5
3. Open main.pyw.
